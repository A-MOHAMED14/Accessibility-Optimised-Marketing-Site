# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Background

Semantic HTML is used to organise content on a webpage by providing meaning and strucutre to the different parts of the page.

Instead of using generic divs to layout content, semantic HTML introduces elements such as `<header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>` and so on. Each element has a specific semantic meaning.

They not only help in organising content for better readability and maintainabilty but also provides valuable infomtion to search engines, accessibility tools, and other devices like screen readers, allowing them to understand the structure and purpose of different parts of the web page.
